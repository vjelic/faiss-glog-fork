If overlap is possible, use a safe copy method or handle the overlap explicitly:\n\n```cpp\nif ((codes_in < &codes[list_no][offset * code_size] &&\n     codes_in + code_size * n_entry > &codes[list_no][offset * code_size]) ||\n    (&codes[list_no][offset * code_size] < codes_in &&\n     &codes[list_no][offset * code_size] + code_size * n_entry > codes_in)) {\n    // Handle overlap, e.g., use memmove\n    memmove(&codes[list_no][offset * code_size], codes_in, code_size * n_entry);\n} else {\n    memcpy(&codes[list_no][offset * code_size], codes_in, code_size * n_entry);\n}\n```\nThis ensures that if the memory regions overlap, the safe `memmove` function is used instead of `memcpy`, which is undefined for overlapping regions.\n\n## In Context Remediation 2\nAlternatively, always use `memmove` instead of `memcpy` if there is any possibility of overlap between the source and destination memory regions:\n\n```cpp\nmemmove(&codes[list_no][offset * code_size], codes_in, code_size * n_entry);\n```\nThis function is designed to handle overlapping memory regions safely, preventing undefined behavior.\n\n## References\n- [OWASP C-Based Toolchain Hardening Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)\n- [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)\n- [OWASP Buffer Overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)\n\n___\n"

In this case, the `fopen` function is used, which can lead to vulnerabilities if the `fname` parameter is not properly validated or controlled.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use safer alternatives to these functions, or ensure that inputs are properly validated and sanitized. In the case of `fopen`, it is important to ensure that the `fname` parameter is a valid and safe file name, and that the file it refers to is intended to be accessed.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\n```cpp\n#include <fstream>\n\nstd::string fname = \"filename.txt\";\nstd::ifstream file(fname);\nif (!file) {\n    // Handle error\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the C++ `ifstream` class is used instead of `fopen`. This class provides a higher level of abstraction and is generally safer to use.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the following library dependencies:\n\n- `<fstream>`\n\n## OWASP Resources\n\n- [OWASP C++ Secure Coding Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/676.html)"

The function counts characters until it reaches a null character (`\\0`). If the string is not null-terminated, `strlen` will continue reading memory until it encounters a null character, potentially leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in undefined behavior, including program crashes, incorrect results, or even code execution.\n\nIn the provided code snippet, the `strlen` function is used to check if the length of the string `sx` is equal to 4. If `sx` is not null-terminated, this could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, always ensure that strings are null-terminated. Avoid using `strlen` on strings that may not be null-terminated. Instead, consider using functions that take the length of the string as an argument, such as `strnlen`, which will not read past the specified length.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReplace the `strlen` function with `strnlen` and add a maximum length to prevent buffer overflow:\n\n```cpp\nFAISS_THROW_IF_NOT(4 == strnlen(sx, MAX_LENGTH))\n```\n\nReplace `MAX_LENGTH` with the maximum length of the string `sx`.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe provided code snippet requires the following libraries:\n\n- `cstring` or `string.h` for `strlen` or `strnlen`\n- `faiss/impl/FaissAssert.h` for `FAISS_THROW_IF_NOT`\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP Buffer Overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)\n- [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)"

This function does not check for any buffer overflow condition, which can lead to a vulnerability if the size of the data being copied is greater than the size of the destination buffer. This can lead to overwriting of adjacent memory and can potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code, denial of service, or information disclosure.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to always ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data being copied. This can be done by checking the size of the destination buffer before calling `memcpy`. If the size of the data being copied is greater than the size of the destination buffer, then the program should handle this condition appropriately, such as by truncating the data or by allocating a larger buffer.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a recommended fix for the specific vulnerability sink:\n\n```cpp\nif (N * K * sizeof(node_t) <= sizeof(data)) {\n    memcpy(data, g.data, N * K * sizeof(node_t));\n} else {\n    // Handle error condition, such as by truncating data or allocating a larger buffer\n}\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe `memcpy` function is part of the C standard library, so no additional library dependencies are required.\n\n## OWASP Resources\n\n- [Buffer Overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)\n\nPlease note that the links provided are valid and active at the time of writing this report."

These functions often do not perform bounds checking or input validation, which can lead to serious security vulnerabilities if not handled properly. In this case, the `memmove` function is used, which can lead to buffer overflow if the size of the destination buffer is smaller than the size of the source buffer.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use safer alternatives to these risky C functions.

Instead, use safer alternatives provided by the C++ Standard Library. For instance, instead of `memmove`, you can use `std::copy` or `std::copy_backward` from `<algorithm>` which are safer and less prone to errors.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReplace the `memmove` function with `std::copy_backward`:\n\n```cpp\n#include <algorithm>\n\nstd::copy_backward(&addr[right], &addr[right] + (size - right), &addr[right + 1] + (size - right));\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the following library dependencies:\n\n- `<cstring>` for `memmove`\n- `<algorithm>` for `std::copy_backward`\n\n## OWASP Resources\n\n- [OWASP Proactive Controls](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/)\n\n## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/676.html)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)"

                "markdown": "## Description\n\n\"Detected Prohibited C Function\" vulnerability refers to the use of certain C standard library functions that are considered unsafe due to their potential to cause buffer overflow, format string, or integer overflow vulnerabilities. In this case, the `memmove` function is used, which can lead to buffer overflow if not used carefully.\n\nBuffer overflow vulnerabilities occur when the volume of data exceeds the storage capacity of the memory buffer. As a result, the program attempting to write the data to the buffer overflows the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use safer alternatives to these functions. For instance, instead of `memmove`, consider using `memcpy_s` or `memmove_s` which are safer as they include the size of the destination buffer as a parameter, helping to prevent buffer overflow.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a safer version of the code using `memmove_s`:\n\n```cpp\n#include <string.h> // for memmove_s\n\nerrno_t err = memmove_s(&codes[code_size * j], sizeof(codes) - code_size * j, &codes[code_size * i], code_size);\nif (err)\n{\n    // Handle error\n}\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the `<string.h>` library for the `memmove` function.\n\n## OWASP and CWE Links\n\n- [OWASP C++](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_SCP_v2.pdf)\n- [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)"
